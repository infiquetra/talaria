## P0

### Run the Textual validation gate

**Author.** Reconsidered language and TUI framework analysis
**Priority.** P0
**Effort.** Medium
**Worth it when.** Before adding product behavior beyond the current Ink bootstrap shell.
**Context.** Drive one bounded Textual projection from a framework-neutral Python reducer and the existing frame-log contract. Prove coalesced streaming, bounded transcript mounting, scroll anchoring, deterministic `run_test()` and `Pilot` behavior, selected pseudo-terminal behavior, framework-independent domain state, strict typing and linting, and clean `uv tool install` launch. Use Bubble Tea v2 only if Textual fails a material gate or a small zero-runtime native executable becomes mandatory.

### Prove the Hermes transport seam

**Author.** Project bootstrap
**Priority.** P0
**Effort.** Medium
**Worth it when.** The prototype shell is ready for the first real integration slice.
**Context.** Talaria needs capability discovery, session lifecycle, prompt streaming, cancellation, and approval handling before UI work can be judged against real Hermes behavior.

## P1

### Build the stable screen model

**Author.** Project bootstrap
**Priority.** P1
**Effort.** Medium
**Worth it when.** Transport fixtures exist and event/state transitions can be tested independently of a terminal.
**Context.** Stable rendering and reduced flicker depend on state-driven rendering rather than direct callback-driven writes.

### Add the sub-agent monitor

**Author.** Project bootstrap
**Priority.** P1
**Effort.** Medium
**Worth it when.** The gateway advertises enough delegation or spawn-tree state to make the pane meaningful.
**Context.** Sub-agent visibility is a primary UX goal.

## P2

### Add MoA progress and fallback rendering

**Author.** Project bootstrap
**Priority.** P2
**Effort.** Medium
**Worth it when.** The first transport path is proven and MoA event capability differences are captured in fixtures.

### Add a deterministic Kanban adapter

**Author.** Project bootstrap
**Priority.** P2
**Effort.** Medium to large
**Worth it when.** The board contract and ownership boundary are clear enough to avoid taking accidental responsibility for dispatcher internals.
**Constraint, verified against Hermes `7f4d15515`.** The adapter cannot sit behind the terminal gateway: `tui_gateway/` registers no `@method("kanban.*")` at all. It does push board _notifications_ — a 5-second poll of `kanban_notify_subs` emitting completed/blocked/gave_up/crashed/timed_out events — so "tell me when a task finishes" is already available there, while "query the board" is not. A queryable adapter has to reach `GatewayRunner` or the API server instead. See [LEARNINGS](LEARNINGS.md).

## P3

### Desktop-like configuration views

**Author.** Project bootstrap
**Priority.** P3
**Effort.** Large
**Worth it when.** The core session workflow is reliable and the gateway configuration methods are capability-described.

## Maybe

### Package Talaria as an independently installable distribution

**Author.** Project bootstrap
**Priority.** Maybe
**Effort.** Medium
**Worth it when.** The client can launch against both local and remote Hermes instances with a stable compatibility story.
