## P0

### Run the Textual validation gate

**Author.** Reconsidered language and TUI framework analysis
**Priority.** P0
**Effort.** Medium
**Worth it when.** Before adding product behavior beyond the current TypeScript bootstrap shell.
**Context.** Drive one bounded Textual projection from a framework-neutral Python reducer and the existing frame-log contract. Prove coalesced streaming, bounded transcript mounting, scroll anchoring, deterministic `run_test()` and `Pilot` behavior, selected pseudo-terminal behavior, framework-independent domain state, strict typing and linting, and clean `uv tool install` launch.
**Amended 2026-08-02 by ADR-0004.** The fallback is no longer Go with Bubble Tea. The language is settled as Python, so a framework failure selects a different Python presentation layer — which is why identifying one is now a prerequisite rather than a contingency. Choose the vertical slice from the Hermes terminal UI feature inventory rather than from a generic renderer stress list, so the gate produces a prototype instead of a harness.

### Identify and assess a Python fallback presentation layer

**Author.** ADR-0004
**Priority.** P0
**Effort.** Small
**Worth it when.** Before the Textual gate runs, so a failure has somewhere to go.
**Context.** Every analysis in the chain evaluated Textual as the only Python candidate; the others were all in other languages. Settling the language on Python therefore leaves the fallback set unevaluated. If Textual fails on transcript cost or pseudo-terminal correctness, nobody has assessed what replaces it. Name at least one alternative and check it against the same gate criteria — enough to know it exists and is plausible, not a full comparative analysis.

### Prove the Hermes transport seam

**Author.** Project bootstrap
**Priority.** P0
**Effort.** Medium
**Worth it when.** The prototype shell is ready for the first real integration slice.
**Context.** Talaria needs capability discovery, session lifecycle, prompt streaming, cancellation, and approval handling before UI work can be judged against real Hermes behavior.

## P1

### Build the stable screen model

**Author.** Project bootstrap
**Priority.** P1
**Effort.** Medium
**Worth it when.** Transport fixtures exist and event/state transitions can be tested independently of a terminal.
**Context.** Stable rendering and reduced flicker depend on state-driven rendering rather than direct callback-driven writes.

### Read Hermes's turn controller and complete the reconciliation-rule catalogue

**Author.** ADR-0003
**Priority.** P1
**Effort.** Small
**Worth it when.** Before the normalization layer is written, since a rule discovered afterwards is a defect found in production.
**Context.** The 2026-08-02 read covered `ui-tui/src/app/createGatewayEventHandler.ts` and found its reusable content is a set of short rules rather than portable machinery. That handler delegates to `ui-tui/src/app/turnController.ts` (1,092 lines) at more than twenty call sites, and only its call surface has been read. The rule catalogue ADR-0003 depends on is incomplete until the controller is read at a pinned revision.

### Add the sub-agent monitor

**Author.** Project bootstrap
**Priority.** P1
**Effort.** Medium
**Worth it when.** The gateway advertises enough delegation or spawn-tree state to make the pane meaningful.
**Context.** Sub-agent visibility is a primary UX goal.

### Attach to a remote (gated) gateway

**Author.** v0.1 prototype plan doc review, 2026-08-02
**Priority.** P1
**Effort.** Medium
**Worth it when.** The operator wants Talaria pointed at a Hermes running on another host. v0.1 is loopback-only by decision, not by limitation.
**Context.** Whether the gateway's auth gate is active is decided entirely by its bind host: `should_require_auth` (`hermes_cli/web_server.py:437-460` at `7f4d15515`) returns true for anything that is not `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `::1`, and RFC1918 addresses count as public. The legacy `--insecure` escape hatch is accepted but **ignored** since the June 2026 `hermes-0day` campaign, so a remote bind cannot be un-gated — the gated path must be implemented.

It is fully reachable for a client that dials a gateway it did not launch, which the v0.1 plan initially doubted. The complete RFC 8252 native-app flow, verified at the pin: `GET /auth/native/authorize` (`hermes_cli/dashboard_auth/routes.py:289`) runs PKCE against a loopback redirect; `POST /auth/native/token` (`:841`) exchanges the code for `{access_token, refresh_token, token_type: "Bearer"}` explicitly intended for OS-keychain storage; `POST /api/auth/ws-ticket` (`:799`) turns that session into `{ticket, ttl_seconds: 30}`; the ticket goes on the `/api/ws` upgrade URL as `?ticket=`; `POST /auth/native/refresh` (`:894`) rotates. Tickets are single-use with a 30-second TTL (`hermes_cli/dashboard_auth/ws_tickets.py:42`).

**The transport seam for this already exists.** v0.1 ships `CredentialProvider` invoked on every dial including reconnects (KTD11), specifically so a per-connection ticket does not require rewriting reconnect. This work is a new `GatedTicketProvider` plus keychain storage and the PKCE loopback listener — not a transport change.

## P2

### Add MoA progress and fallback rendering

**Author.** Project bootstrap
**Priority.** P2
**Effort.** Medium
**Worth it when.** The first transport path is proven and MoA event capability differences are captured in fixtures.

### Add a deterministic Kanban adapter

**Author.** Project bootstrap
**Priority.** P2
**Effort.** Medium to large
**Worth it when.** The board contract and ownership boundary are clear enough to avoid taking accidental responsibility for dispatcher internals.
**Constraint, verified against Hermes `7f4d15515`.** The adapter cannot sit behind the terminal gateway: `tui_gateway/` registers no `@method("kanban.*")` at all. It does push board _notifications_ — a 5-second poll of `kanban_notify_subs` emitting completed/blocked/gave_up/crashed/timed_out events — so "tell me when a task finishes" is already available there, while "query the board" is not. A queryable adapter has to reach `GatewayRunner` or the API server instead. See [LEARNINGS](LEARNINGS.md).

## P3

### Desktop-like configuration views

**Author.** Project bootstrap
**Priority.** P3
**Effort.** Large
**Worth it when.** The core session workflow is reliable and the gateway configuration methods are capability-described.

## Maybe

### Package Talaria as an independently installable distribution

**Author.** Project bootstrap
**Priority.** Maybe
**Effort.** Medium
**Worth it when.** The client can launch against both local and remote Hermes instances with a stable compatibility story.
